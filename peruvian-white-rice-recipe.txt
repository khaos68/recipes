Ingredients:
 - 1 cup of log white rice
 - 2 cloves garlic, chopped
 - 1 cup of water
 - 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon vinegar
 - 1/2 spoon vegetable oil

Directions:
 1. Wash the rice till the water runs clear. Leave it to rinse.
 2. Brown the garlic in a bot.
 2. Add the water, salt, pepper and vinegar.
 3. Wait for the water to star boiling and add the rice.
 4. With the bot covered, at mid heat, wait to the rice to absorve almost all the water. Wait until you see only small bubbles on the rice surface.
